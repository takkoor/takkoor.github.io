  <h1>Designing Choice Architecture in Higher Education</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    How curriculum design decisions shape user behavior, engagement, and access at scale
  </p>

  <div class="tldr">
    <strong>TL;DR</strong><br />
    I studied how changes to General Education requirements across six public universities in Texas reshaped student course enrollment.
    By analyzing a large, real-world system with constrained choices, I identified how default structures, as opposed to preferences alone, strongly
    influence user behavior. This project demonstrates my ability to translate complex systems research into actionable insights for
    product and systems design.
  </div>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    Universities function as large decision-making systems. Students must choose courses that affect their time, finances,
    and future career paths. They make these decisions often with limited information and high cognitive load.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2014, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board redesigned General Education requirements at public universities.
    This policy change altered the <em>default academic pathways</em> students encountered, creating a natural opportunity to
    study how structural design decisions influence user behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    How do changes to default requirements affect student decision-making and engagement?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do users actively seek options once structural guidance is removed?</li>
    <li>Which users are most sensitive to changes in defaults?</li>
    <li>How does reduced structure affect early-stage engagement?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These questions closely parallel product design challenges around onboarding, choice overload,
    and system defaults.
  </p>

  <h2>Users & Stakeholders</h2>
  <h3>Primary users</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Undergraduate students, especially first-year and undecided students</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Secondary stakeholders</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Academic departments (funding tied to enrollment)</li>
    <li>Faculty</li>
    <li>University administrators</li>
    <li>Policymakers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These groups often have competing incentives, similar to enterprise product environments
    where multiple personas interact with the same system.
  </p>

  <h2>Constraints</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Students face bounded rationality: many choices, unclear consequences</li>
    <li>No direct visibility into user intent—only observed behavior</li>
    <li>Curriculum changes must fit within fixed credit limits</li>
    <li>Departments adapt in multiple ways simultaneously, creating confounding effects</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    These constraints required inferring user needs and behavior from real-world usage patterns
    rather than relying on stated preferences. This is common in product analytics and behavioral research.
  </div>

  <h2>Research & Methods</h2>
  <p>
    I analyzed longitudinal enrollment data (2010–2023) from six four-year public universities in Texas,
    combining course catalogs with administrative transcript data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than evaluating course content, I focused on how <strong>classification, visibility, and defaults</strong>
    alone influenced behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Insights</h2>

  <h3>1. Defaults strongly shape behavior</h3>
  <p>
    Courses designated as General Education requirements consistently saw higher enrollment,
    even when course content remained unchanged.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Early-stage users are most sensitive</h3>
  <p>
    Introductory and “easy entry” courses experienced the largest enrollment drops when removed
    from General Education requirements.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Structure matters more than preference</h3>
  <p>
    When courses lost their General Education status, many students did not actively seek them out,
    suggesting engagement was driven more by system design than intrinsic interest.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Opportunities & Product Implications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Intentional defaults:</strong> Defaults should be treated as core design decisions,
      not neutral settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guided exploration:</strong> Systems that balance autonomy with structure reduce
      decision paralysis during early user journeys.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Equity-aware design:</strong> Users with less prior knowledge rely more heavily on system cues,
      making default design a key access lever.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzed 200,000+ course enrollments</li>
    <li>Identified structural drivers of engagement shifts</li>
    <li>Insights applicable to education systems, policy design, and product onboarding</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I’d Build Next</h2>
  <p>
    If I were designing a product in this space, I would explore:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A planning interface that visualizes downstream impacts of early choices</li>
    <li>“What-if” simulations to test system changes before rollout</li>
    <li>Lightweight nudges that support informed decision-making without restricting autonomy</li>
  </ul>
